# William Mori's Personal Repository
I make small Python projects often revolving around things that catch my interest.  I find games ranging from videogames to boardgames to sport games interesting and the aspect of making programs to facilate some aspect of these games a fun challenge.  I am currently in the process of moving more personal proejects from my student account over to this account.

Projects on this profile are strictly personal projects, all past student work is on my student profile [@wmoriUCI](https://github.com/wmoriUCI) in private repositories.  Access to view this repositories is only granted via email request.
